# 🚗 Car Tracking Game

A **real-time interactive driving simulation** built with **Google Maps API**, designed for **road safety awareness** and **hackathon demonstration**.
Players earn points for following traffic rules, maintaining speed limits, and performing safe overtakes — all visualized on a live map.

---

## 🌍 Live Overview

This project integrates **live Google Maps data** and simulates car movement with gamified safety scoring.
It features a **login with document upload**, **real-time dashboard**, and **leaderboard** for top sessions.

---

## 🎮 Features

* 🧭 **Live Google Maps Integration** (supports geometry & places libraries)
* 📄 **Login System with Document Upload** (Driver’s License + Aadhar for demo verification)
* 🏎️ **Interactive Vehicle Tracking**
* ⚙️ **Dynamic Dashboard**

  * Real-time Speed Display
  * Speed Limit Indicator
  * Overtake Simulation
  * Call Simulation + Timer
* 🧠 **AI-based Point System**

  * Gain points for safe driving
  * Lose points for violations (speeding, distracted driving)
* 🏆 **Leaderboard & Score History**
* 📱 **Responsive Layout for Desktop and Mobile**

## 🔑 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-tracking-game.git
cd car-tracking-game
```

### 2. Add Your Google Maps API Key

Open `index.html` and replace:

```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY&libraries=geometry,places"></script>
```

with your actual API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

### 3. Run Locally

Open `index.html` in your browser directly
—or— use a local server:

```bash
npx live-server
```

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Login Page**
   Upload your Aadhar and License images (for simulation).
   Once both are uploaded, the “Login” button activates.

2. **Map Display**
   A Google Map loads, showing your simulated position.

3. **Dashboard**
   Displays current speed, points, and safety events (calls, overtakes).

4. **Scoring System**

   * +10 points for safe overtake
   * -5 points for overspeeding
   * -10 points for using phone (during simulated call)

5. **Leaderboard**
   Stores and displays top 5 sessions locally.

## 🧪 Hackathon Demo Ready

This project is designed for **smart mobility or road safety hackathons**, where participants showcase AI-powered, map-integrated, and gamified driving solutions.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Real GPS tracking via mobile sensors
* AI-based speed detection
* Integration with Firebase leaderboard
* 3D vehicle model rendering using Three.js
* Voice alerts for rule violations
